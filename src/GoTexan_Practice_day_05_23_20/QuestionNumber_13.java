     1. Complete the Car.java class: Include the following class variables:

* make
* model
* numberOfDoors
* topSpeed
* price

    All class variables should be declared case sensitive
    Write four constructors:
            * The main constructor that can initialize all variables
            * A secondary constructor that does not include numberOfDoors, which should default to 4
            * A secondary constructor that does not include make and model; both default to "unknown"
            * A secondary constructor that does not include topSpeed or price; default to 90 and 0 respectively.
